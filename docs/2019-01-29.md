## Analysis

- break into "frames"
  + choose: window size, window function, overlap
- get spectrum
  + (probably) ignore phase spectrum
  + calculate statistics
    * find peaks
    + spectral shape[^shape], slope, center
- (maybe) classify frame as "pitchy" or "noisy"
- (later) use Sinusoids and Band-passed noise to synthesis sound given analysis

[^shape]: Imagine ways to approximate arbitrary functions... consider summing many [Gaussian] functions.

Listing: Analyse
``` {#lst:analyse}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // open sound file for analysis
  // open output file
  // load samples
  // for each window of samples
  //   calculate: mean/max magnitude
  //   find maxima (frequency and magnitude)
  //   sort maxima by magnitude
  //   save top 10
}
```

Listing: Synthesize
``` {#lst:synthesize}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // load analysis file
  // set up sinusoid oscillators
  // set up band-passed noise oscillators
  // loop
  //   given time parameter, generate interpolated frame
  //   dispatch oscillators to support peaks and spectral shape
  //   (maybe) advance time
}
