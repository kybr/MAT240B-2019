## Analysis

- break into "frames"
  + choose: window size, window function, overlap
- get spectrum
  + (probably) ignore phase spectrum
  + calculate statistics
    * find peaks
    + spectral shape[^shape], slope, center
- (maybe) classify frame as "pitchy" or "noisy"
- (later) use Sinusoids and Band-passed noise to synthesis sound given analysis

[^shape]: Imagine ways to approximate arbitrary functions... consider summing many [Gaussian] functions.
